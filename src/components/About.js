        <p>
        I'm a full-stack developer with a strong leaning toward frontend development â€” <b>React</b> is where I'm most comfortable, but I've gained experience working with frameworks like <b>Next.js, Django, Flask, Spring, Angular, and Express</b> through hands-on projects and internships.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m a quick learner who enjoys picking up new stacks and solving problems wherever Iâ€™m needed.</p>

<p>Beyond web development, I take a keen interest in low-level programming and systemsâ€”diving into C++ and networking fundamentals in my spare time just to better understand the layers beneath the code I write.</p>
<p>I'm proficient in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, C, and C++, and I've spent time improving my problem-solving skills on platforms like Leetcode, Hackerrank (5â˜…).</p>
<p>I'm <b>certified</b> in cloud and databases â€” <b>AWS, Azure, and Oracle</b>, ready to architect and scale like a pro!</p>
<p>I also actively participate in hackathons and enjoy building under pressure â€” notable achievements include being a <b>Top 8 Finalist</b> (out of 6000+ participants) in <b>Barclays Hack-O-Hire 2025</b>, <b>ðŸ¥‡ Winner</b> at <b>Day Zero Hackathon</b> (5000+ participants across India), and <b>ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd Runner-up</b> at <b>Hack the Cosmos Hackathon</b> (among 200+ teams nationwide).</p>

<p>I love collaborating on real-world problems, building scalable solutions, and constantly growing as a developer â€” one bug (or feature) at a time.</p>
